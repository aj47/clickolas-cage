# clickolas-cage

> a chrome extension that performs web browsing actions autonomously to complete a given goal/task (using GPT-4 as a brain).

## Structure

- Popup.jsx
  - contains the popup shown when the extension is clicked
- Content script
  - this should execute DOM actions
- Background.js
  - this should hold the execution plan and history.

## Installing

1. Check if your `Node.js` version is >= **14**.
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. you need to either be running a local model on `http://localhost:1234` or change the openAI config in `src/utils.js`

## Developing

run the command

```shell
$ cd clickolas-cage

$ npm run dev
```

### Chrome Extension Developer Mode

1. set your Chrome browser 'Developer mode' up
2. click 'Load unpacked', and select `clickolas-cage/build` folder

### Nomal FrontEnd Developer Mode

1. access `http://0.0.0.0:3000/`
2. when debugging popup page, open `http://0.0.0.0:3000//popup.html`
3. when debugging options page, open `http://0.0.0.0:3000//options.html`

## Packing

After the development of your extension run the command

```shell
$ npm run build
```

Now, the content of `build` folder will be the extension ready to be submitted to the Chrome Web Store. Just take a look at the [official guide](https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/publish) to more infos about publishing.
