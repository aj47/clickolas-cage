## Installing

1. Check if your `Node.js` version is >= **14**.
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. replace your GEMINI api key in `.env.template` and rename the file  to `.env`

## Developing

run these commands to run everything locally:
```shell
$ cd clickolas-cage

$ npm run dev
```
and in a seperate terminal:
```shell
$ npx @portkey-ai/gateway
```
This runs the chrome extension locally.

To link the running extension to chrome:
1. set your Chrome browser 'Developer mode' on
2. click 'Load unpacked', and select `clickolas-cage/build` folder

The main source files are:
- `src/popup/popup.jsx` The popup window that shows when you press the extension icon
- `src/background/background.js` Persists and facilitates planning
- `src/contentScript/contentScript.js` Executes on web pages, executes actions and scrapes elements
- `src/utils.js` Helper functions
- `src/llm-utils.js` LLM helper functions

### Current Flow
1. User clicks extension icon, enters and submits goal prompt
2. Popup.jsx sends a message to background.js with request type 'new_goal'
3. background.js calls promptToFirstStep() in llm-utils.js
4. LLM returns starting URL which feeds into navURL()
5. navURL will open a new tab with the starting URL
6. getNextStep() is called which will get contentScript to extract clickable elements and send it to LLM to generate next step




## Packing

After the development of your extension run the command

```shell
$ npm run build
```

Now, the content of `build` folder will be the extension ready to be submitted to the Chrome Web Store. Just take a look at the [official guide](https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/publish) to more infos about publishing.
