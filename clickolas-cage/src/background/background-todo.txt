 2 Implement error handling: Many asynchronous operations lack proper error handling. You could wrap them in try-catch blocks and implement a consistent error handling strategy.
 3 Use async/await consistently: Some parts of the code use .then() chains while others use async/await. Converting all to async/await would improve readability.
 4 Extract repeated code into helper functions: There are several instances of repeated code (e.g., chrome.debugger.sendCommand) that could be extracted into helper functions.
 5 Use object destructuring: In many places, you could use object destructuring to make the code more concise.
 6 Implement a logging system: Instead of using console.log everywhere, implement a logging system that can be easily turned on/off for debugging.
 7 Use constants for string literals: Many string literals (like message types) are repeated throughout the code. These could be extracted into constants.
 8 Simplify the state management: The current state management could be simplified, possibly by using a reducer pattern.
 9 Implement a more robust retry mechanism: The current retry mechanism in sendMessageToTab could be improved and made more generic.
 10 Use optional chaining: In some places, you could use optional chaining to simplify null checks.
 11 Implement proper TypeScript or JSDoc types: Adding proper types would improve code reliability and developer experience.
